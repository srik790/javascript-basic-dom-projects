Hello Coders!!

For completing challenge 3 you need to understand some concepts like.

1) debugging,
2) Api 

Debugging is technique to find the bug in the code. Today we learned how to hit the debugger.
Debugging can be compared to as checking CCTV footage for finding any crime where we go to specific time and they play and pause the footage to find out what is actually happening.

These video will help you to understand debugging

We have attached some videos to go through these concepts and expect you to go through these videos and prepare your doubts that we can discuss in class.


In challenge 4 we will go through the important concepts of javascript like
variables, functions,loops, conditions, arrays and objects. Also fixing lots of buggy code like fix-surprise-me.
Your learning from past challenges will play a major role and will further strengthen your knowledge. So you are requested to complete the challenge 3 before day 45 so that you can take the full advantage of it.

We have also prepared 100 javascripts projects for you where you will build ecommerce websites, games etc. So get ready for it.
Happy Coding!!!!!
